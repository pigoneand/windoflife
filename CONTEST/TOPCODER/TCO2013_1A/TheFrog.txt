PROBLEM STATEMENT
Frog Jim is fond of jumping.
Moreover, all his jumps have the same length X.
Currently, he is standing at the point 0 on the real axis.
He needs to jump along the axis until he gets to point D or beyond it.

There are several pits between points 0 and D. 
For each valid i, there is a pit strictly between L[i] and R[i].
This means that Jim cannot step onto any point that is strictly between points L[i] and R[i].
(He is allowed to step onto the points L[i] and R[i]: as all pits are disjoint, the endpoints of each pit are always safe.)

Find the minimum length of jump X such that if Jim performs only jumps of length X, he can avoid every pit and get to point D or any point beyond it. Note that this length can be non-integer.

DEFINITION
Class:TheFrog
Method:getMinimum
Parameters:int, vector <int>, vector <int>
Returns:double
Method signature:double getMinimum(int D, vector <int> L, vector <int> R)


NOTES
-The returned value must have an absolute or relative error less than 1e-9.


CONSTRAINTS
-D will be between 1 and 30,000, inclusive.
-L will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of L will be between 0 and D-1, inclusive.
-R will contain the same number of elements as L.
-The i-th element of R will be between L[i]+1 and D, inclusive.
-The intervals given by (L[i], R[i]) will not intersect.


EXAMPLES

0)
16
{2}
{7}

Returns: 7.0

Moving by jumps of length 7, Jim goes from point 0 to point 7, then to point 14 and then to point 21, which is beyond 16. If Jim chose a shorter jump, he would end up in the pit.

1)
25
{11, 3}
{21, 7}

Returns: 10.5

There are two pits. One of them is between points 11 and 21 and the other between points 3 and 7. By fixing jump length at 10.5, Jim successfully avoids them.

2)
100
{0}
{100}

Returns: 100.0

Jim has no other choice but to jump right to point 100.

3)
100
{0, 50}
{50, 100}

Returns: 50.0

In this case, point 50 is a suitable place to land, so Jim can choose X = 50.

4)
30000
{17, 25281, 5775, 2825, 14040}
{55, 26000, 5791, 3150, 14092}

Returns: 787.8787878787879
