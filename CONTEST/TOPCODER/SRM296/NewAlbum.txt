PROBLEM STATEMENT
A popular musical group 'Flattened' has decided to release a new album.
It consists of nSongs songs. All songs are of the same length (given in seconds). A CD can store cdCapacity seconds of audio. 
Each pair of consecutive songs must be separated by a 1 second pause.
The group director is superstitious, so the number of songs on a CD must never be divisible by 13.
Given these constraints, return the smallest number of CDs required to fit the entire album.
