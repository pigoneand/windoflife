PROBLEM STATEMENT
One Saturday evening you are playing a game of online Scrabble. Your opponent is a very good player, but this time you managed to win. After a brief conversation, you are told: "I am clearly better than you, but one game is simply not enough to prove it." Your opponent then makess the following bet: "If we play 10 games, you will win less than 5 ... and this will happen every time, even if we try this 10 times in a row!". 

You will solve a more general problem using the following parameters: 
- an int  trials  denoting the number of meetings in which a set of games is played. 
- an int  games  denoting the number of games that are to be played in each meeting.
- an int  winsNeeded  denoting the number of victories you need in one of the meetings to win the bet. 
- an int  winChance  denoting the probability in percent of winning one particular game. 
Return a double between 0 and 1, denoting the probability you have to win the bet.

There are 4 possible ways a meeting could evolve: 
 - you lose both games.
 - you lose game 1 and you win game 2.
 - you win game 1 and you lose game 2.
 - you win both games. 
Your opponent has a 1/4 chance of not losing the bet after the first meeting. Since there are two meetings, your opponent's chances to win the bet are 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. Thus, you have a 15/16 chance to win the bet.
