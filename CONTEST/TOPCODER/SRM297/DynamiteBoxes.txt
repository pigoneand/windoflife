PROBLEM STATEMENT

Consider a 2 x 2 x height stack of cube-shaped boxes of identical size. The stack has height levels of boxes, each level containing 4 boxes arranged in a 2 x 2 pattern. Each box has a 50% probability of containing dynamite and a 50% probability of being empty. Two dynamite-filled boxes, A and B, are in the same dynamite cluster if:


a face of A touches a face of B
OR a face of A touches a face of some box C, and C is in the same dynamite cluster as B.

A stack is dangerous if it contains a dynamite cluster that contains at least dangerousClusterSize boxes. Given height and dangerousClusterSize, compute the probability that the stack is dangerous.

DEFINITION
Class:DynamiteBoxes
Method:getProbability
Parameters:int, int
Returns:double
Method signature:double getProbability(int height, int dangerousClusterSize)


NOTES
-Your answer must be within 1E-9 absolute or relative error.


CONSTRAINTS
-height will be between 1 and 30, inclusive.
-dangerousClusterSize will be between 1 and 121, inclusive.

Returns: 0.9375

Here, any stack that contains a dynamite-filled box is dangerous. There are 16 possible 2 x 2 x 1 stacks, each occurring with the same probability. Only one of the possible stacks is not dangerous - the stack with no dynamite-filled boxes. So, the answer is 15/16 = 0.9375.

2

Returns: 0.5625

In this example, stacks that contain dynamite-filled boxes that don't touch any other dynamite-filled boxes are not dangerous. There are 7 such stacks: 1 with no dynamite-filled boxes, 4 with a single dynamite-filled box, and 2 with two dynamite-filled boxes each placed diagonally so that they don't touch each other. The answer then is 1 - 7/16 = 0.5625.
